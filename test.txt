Een derde verbeterde versie, voor de periode 2004-2009, werd participatief opgesteld in 2003-04 en goedgekeurd door het parlement. De nieuwe PEAP wordt door de donors als een goed basisdocument beschouwd. Het budget voor 2005/06 werd op basis van deze nieuwe versie opgesteld, zodat de prioriteiten de nodige budgettaire vertaling zullen krijgen.De PEAP policy matrix is een belangrijk middel om voor- of achteruitgang te meten betreffende het bestuur van het land en helpt de GoU-donors dialoog te versterken. Uit de vooruitzichten voor het bereiken van de MDG's (opgenomen in het PEAP) kan men vaststellen dat er voor basisgezondheidszorg, vooral voor preventieve zorgen voor moeders en jonge kinderen, nog veel meer aandacht en fondsen nodig zijn.

 directorate general for cooperation and development donor government support to the military families of kindu camps (2nd phase) and lokandu - famiki ii / familo belgium has military partnerships (program de partenariat militaire - ppm), with several countries in africa, to support the reform of the security sector on the spot and to contribute to the establishment of a professional national army, which serves its population and respect human rights. the military partnership with the democratic republic congo mainly involves the formation, monitoring and evaluation of an 'urr' brigade (unitÃ© de rÃ©action rapide - a sort of para commando) consisting of three elite battalions (321e, 322e and 323e bataillons de rÃ©action rapide) te kindu, besides the formation, the guidance and evaluation of the teachers of the military academy of kananga and the genie school in likasi. the 321st battalion was formed at the end of 2008-early 2009 to kananga, the 322th battalion at the end of 2011-early 2012 to child and finally the 323th battalion in the course of 2013 too kindu. remains the formation of the brigade's staff that will frame the three elite battalions formed. when a soldier in the democratic republic congo is assigned a place to stay there temporarily, his family almost always pulls along. these movements often result in difficult living conditions for the families. those families should seek accommodation, health care, a school for their child and agricultural land to produce food. this often happens at the expense of the local population with conflicts as a result. in order to stop this trend, the congolese government and the army (fardc - forces armÃ©es de la rÃ©publique dÃ©mocratique du congo) (military forces) want to give the military and their families a permanent residence. the intention is to house the military in garrison towns across the country. so the soldiers who leave on mission will be reassured that their family is safe and soundly housed. kindu located in the province of maniema is one of those garrison towns. the three belgian-trained battalions are housed in child and surroundings, more specifically the 321st battalion in the military camp lwama, the 322th battalion in the military camp lokandu and the 323rd battalion in the military camp jericho.nu were these military camps in a lamentable condition due to neglect due to the wars that the drc had known in recent years. the belgian defense in its partnership agreement with the drc provides for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure of those camps, but insufficient funds were provided for the accommodation of the military. consequently, our fod foreign affairs, foreign trade and development cooperation were asked to contribute financially for the rehabilitation of housing in these camps as part of a 3d approach (dÃ©fence, diplomacy and dÃ©veloppement). in a first phase it was decided to rehabilitate the camp lwama. general purpose: contribuer Ã  la consolidation de la sÃ©curitÃ© avec le rÃ©tablissement de l'autoritÃ© de l'etat dans la partie est de la rdc et dans la province du maniema en particulier.specific results: volet a: famiki iir1. des logements dÃ©cents pour 223 servicemen et leur familles sont construits; r2. l'accÃ¨s Ã  l'eau potable pour les familles du camp est assurÃ©; r3. des activitÃ©s sociales, y inclus des activitÃ©s gÃ©nÃ©ratrices de revenus, sont fournies et pÃ©rennisÃ©es.volet b: familor4. des logements dÃ©cents sont construits pour 200 familles the military r5. l'accÃ¨s Ã  l'eau potable pour les familles du camp est assurÃ©.specific purpose: les conditions de vie des familles des militaryes des camps de kindu et lokandu aisi que des populations avoisinantes sont amÃ©liorÃ©es. 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development BTC - Belgian Technical Cooperation - BTC Appui aux familles militaires des camps de Kindu (2ième phase) et Lokandu - FAMIKI II/FAMILO België heeft militaire partnerschappen (Programme de Partenariat Militaire - PPM), met verschillende landen in Afrika, teneinde er ter plaatse de hervorming van de veiligheidssector te ondersteunen en mee te werken aan de oprichting van een professioneel nationaal leger, dat ten diensten staat van haar bevolking en de mensenrechten eerbiedigt. Het militaire partnerschap met de Democratische Republiek Congo omvat vooral de vorming van, toezicht op en evaluatie van een 'URR' brigade (Unité de Réaction Rapide  - een soort paracommando's) bestaande uit drie elite bataljons (321e, 322e en 323e Bataillons de Réaction Rapide) te Kindu, naast de vorming, de begeleiding en evaluatie van de onderrichters van de Militaire Academie van Kananga en van de Genieschool in Likasi. Het 321e bataljon werd eind 2008-begin 2009 gevormd te Kananga, het 322e bataljon eind 2011-begin 2012 te Kindu en tenslotte het 323e bataljon in de loop van 2013 te Kindu. Blijft nog de vorming van de staf van de brigade die de drie gevormde elite bataljons zal omkaderen. Wanneer een militair in de Democratische Republiek Congo een standplaats krijgt toegewezen om er tijdelijk te verblijven, trekt zijn gezin bijna altijd mee. Deze verplaatsingen resulteren vaak in moeilijke levensomstandigheden voor de families. Die families dienen op zoek te gaan naar een onderkomen, naar gezondheidszorgen, naar een school voor hun kinderen en naar landbouwgrond om voedsel te kunnen produceren. Dit gebeurt vaak ten koste van de lokale populatie met conflicten als gevolg. Om aan deze tendens een halt toe te roepen, willen de Congolese regering en de Stafdienst van het leger (FARDC  Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo) de militairen en hun gezin een vaste woonplaats bezorgen. Het is de bedoeling de militairen te huisvesten in garnizoensteden verspreid over het hele land. Zo zullen de militairen die op missie vertrekken, gerust gesteld zijn dat hun familie veilig en degelijk gehuisvest is.Kindu gelegen in de provincie Maniema is één van die garnizoensteden. De drie door België opgeleide bataljons worden gehuisvest te Kindu en omgeving, meer bepaald het 321e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lwama, het 322e bataljon in het militaire kamp Lokandu en het 323e bataljon in het militaire kamp Jericho.Nu bevonden deze militaire kampen zich in een lamentabele toestand wegens verwaarlozing ingevolge de oorlogen die de DRC de laatste jaren had gekend. De Belgische defensie in zijn partnerschapsakkoord met de DRC voorziet in de rehabilitatie van de infrastructuur van die kampen maar er waren onvoldoende fondsen voorzien voor de huisvesting van de militairen. Bijgevolg werd aan onze FOD Buitenlandse Zaken, Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking in het kader van een 3D benadering (défence, diplomatie et développement) gevraagd financieel bij te dragen voor de rehabilitatie van de huisvesting in deze kampen. In een eerste fase werd besloten het kamp Lwama te Kindu te rehabiliteren. GENERAL PURPOSE:  Contribuer à la consolidation de la sécurité avec le rétablissement de l'Autorité de l'Etat dans la partie EST de la RDC et dans la province du Maniema en particulier.SPECIFIC RESULTS:  Volet A: FAMIKI IIR1. Des logements décents pour 223 militaires et leur familles sont construits ;R2. L'accès à l'eau potable pour les familles du camp est assuré ;R3.

 directorate general for cooperation and development donor government agricultural development programme in the province of eastern kasai - prodakor a round table on agriculture that was jointly organised by belgium, food and agriculture organisation and the dr congo in march 2004, urged spending at least 10% of the cooperation budget on agricultural and rural development. after all, 70% of the congolese population depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and most small farmers live below the poverty line despite the fact that the congo is a country with enormous agricultural potential. the reason for this is that congolese agriculture is in crisis as a result of successive armed conflicts and the collapse of government structures. the processing and marketing of agricultural production is complicated by inadequate infrastructure (roads, means of transport, storage facilities, etc.) and discouraged by unlawful levies and other 'tracassies' due to military and civil servants and by cheap imported products from abroad. the time had come to shift the focus from food aid to sustainable development of the agricultural sector with the necessary support for food production and institutional capacity building (including the decentralisation process). investments in agricultural and rural development help improve the liveability of rural areas, reducing migratory pressure on cities, and promote an increase in local food production that can contribute to the supply of urban markets. the objective is to ensure food security on the basis of our own congolese agricultural production. since the resumption of governmental cooperation in 2000, almost 23 million eur in the agricultural sector has so far been invested in the dr congo. in this way btc has gained experience in the seed, fish farming and agricultural management sector in the provinces of bas-congo, bandundu, oriental, kasaÃ¯ oriental and katanga. in principle, all these projects will expire before the end of 2013 and will be partly taken over by the new agricultural projects planned for the isp 2010-2013. the isp 2010-2013, signed on 21 december 2009, prevented three focal sectors, namely agriculture. rehabilitation of rural roads and education (see appendix 1). the agricultural interventions will be realized together with the rehabilitation of the agricultural roads in the same 4 concentration areas, namely the districts kwilu and kwango (province bandundu), the district tshopo (province orientale), the districts tshilenge, kabinda and sankuru (province kasaÃ¯ oriental) and the south of the province of maniema. for this purpose, detailed budgets are provided: 88.5 million eur for agriculture and 104 million eur for rural access, which together account for 192.5 million eur or nearly 50% of the total budget of the isp 2010-13 (300 million + 100 million extra) if certain conditions are met - 'tranche incitative') the expected results for the agriculture sector that have been defined in the 2010-2013 is the following: 1.augmentation de la productivitÃ© des exploitation agricoles ruraux pour passer d'une agriculture de subsidy for agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, etc. the environment are retained as transversal themes as well as good governance. in march 2012, the development cooperation office of ambabel kinshasa with the congolese government an identification studio organised in mbuji mayi, the capital of the province of kasaÃ¯ oriental. this workshop provided the basic eleme purpose: le dÃ©ficit alimentaire et la pauvretÃ© dans la province du kasaÃ¯ oriental sont rÃ©duits par la relance durable du secteur agricole.specific results: le projet veillera Ã  poursuivre les rÃ©sultats suivants: 1.la production et la productivitÃ© des exploitations agricoles est amÃ©liorÃ©e afin the passe 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development BTC - Belgian Technical Cooperation - BTC Programme de Développement Agricole dans la Province du Kasaï Oriental - PRODAKOR Een rondetafel over landbouw die in maart 2004 gezamenlijk werd georganiseerd door België, FAO en de DR Congo, drong erop aan ten minste 10% van het samenwerkingsbudget te besteden aan landbouw- en rurale ontwikkeling. Immers, 70% van de Congolese bevolking is voor zijn levensonderhoud afhankelijk van de landbouw en de meeste kleine boeren leven onder de armoedegrens niettegenstaande Congo een land is met een enorm landbouwpotentieel. De reden hiervoor is dat de Congolese landbouw in crisis is ingevolge de opeenvolgende gewapende conflicten en de ineenstorting van de overheidsstructuren. Het verwerken en vermarkten van de landbouwproductie wordt bemoeilijkt door gebrekkige infrastructuur (wegen, transportmiddelen, opslagfaciliteiten, enz.) en ontmoedigd door onwetmatige heffingen en andere 'tracasseries' vanwege militairen en ambtenaren en door goedkoop ingevoerde producten uit het buitenland. De tijd was aangebroken om het accent te verschuiven van voedselhulp naar duurzame ontwikkeling van de landbouwsector met de nodige steun voor voedselproductie en institutionele capaciteitsopbouw (waaronder het decentralisatieproces). Investeringen in landbouw- en rurale ontwikkeling helpen de leefbaarheid van het platteland te verbeteren waardoor de migratiedruk op de steden afneemt, en bevorderen een verhoging van de lokale voedselproductie die kan bijdragen aan de bevoorrading van stedelijke markten. Streefdoel is het verzekeren van voedselzekerheid op basis van de eigen Congolese landbouwproductie.Sinds de hervatting van de gouvernementele samenwerking in 2000 werd tot nu toe bijna 23 miljoen EUR in de landbouwsector geïnvesteerd in de DR Congo. BTC heeft op die manier ervaring opgedaan in de sector zaaigoed, visteelt en landbouwbestuur in de provincies Bas-Congo, Bandundu, Oriental,  Kasaï Oriental en Katanga. Al deze projecten lopen in principe af voor einde 2013 en zullen (uitgezonderd PRODEPAAK) gedeeltelijk worden overgenomen door de in het ISP 2010-2013 voorziene nieuwe landbouwprojecten.Het ISP 2010-2013, ondertekend op 21 december 2009, weerhield drie concentratiesectoren, namelijk landbouw, rehabilitatie van plattelandswegen en onderwijs (zie bijlage 1). De interventies in de landbouw zullen te samen met de rehabilitatie van de landbouwwegen worden gerealiseerd in dezelfde 4 concentratiegebieden, namelijk de districten Kwilu en Kwango (province Bandundu), het district Tshopo (province Orientale), de districten Tshilenge, Kabinda en Sankuru (province Kasaï Oriental) en het zuiden van de provincie Maniema. Hiervoor worden omstandige budgetten voorzien: 88,5 miljoen EUR voor landbouw en 104 miljoen EUR voor rurale ontsluiting, samen goed voor 192,5 miljoen EUR of bijna 50% van het totale budget van het ISP 2010-13 (300 miljoen + 100 miljoen extra indien aan bepaalde voorwaarden wordt voldaan  'tranche incitative').De verwachte resultaten voor de sector landbouw die werden gedefinieerd in het ISP 2010-2013 zijn de volgende:1.augmentation de la productivité des exploitants agricoles ruraux pour passer d'une agriculture de subsistance à une agriculture de marché avec appui à un nombre limité de filières agricoles;2.amélioration de la transformation et de la commercialisation des produits des exploitations familiales;3.amélioration durable de la gouvernance du secteur agricole dans les zones de concentration.Gender en milieu worden weerhouden als transversale thema's evenals goed bestuur.In maart 2012 heeft het bureau ontwikkelingssamenwerking van Ambabel Kinshasa met de Congolese overheid een identificatie atelier georganiseerd in Mbuji Mayi, de hoofdplaats van de provincie Kasaï Oriental. Dit atelier leverde de basiselemeGENERAL PURPOSE:  Le déficit alimentaire et la pauvreté dans la province du Kasaï oriental sont réduits par la relance durable du secteur agricole.SPECIFIC RESULTS:  Le projet veillera à poursuivre les résultats suivants :1.La production et la productivité des exploitations agricoles est améliorée afin de passe

 directorate general for cooperation and development donor government programme of opening up in the district of the tshopo - eastern province (prodet) it isp 2010-2013, signed on 21 december 2009, stopped three focal sectors, namely agriculture, rehabilitation of rural roads and education (see appendix 1). agricultural interventions will be realized together with the rehabilitation of agricultural roads in the same 4 concentration areas, namely the districts of kwilu and kwango (province bandundu), the districts tshilenge, kabinda and sankuru (province of kasaÃ¯ oriental), the district of tshopo (province orientale), and the south of the province of maniema. for this purpose, detailed budgets are provided: 63.5 million eur for agriculture and 89 million eur for rural access, which together account for 152.5 million eur or 50% of the total budget of the isp 2010-13 (300 million). end may 2012 the development cooperation office of ambabel kinshasa has organised an identification workshop in kisangani with the congolese government. this workshop provided the basic elements for the creation of two identification sheets, one for the agriculture sector (program de dÃ©veloppement agricole dans the district de la tshopo - prodat) and the other for the sector 'pistes et bacs' (program de dÃ©senclavement dans le district de la tshopo - prodet). the two identification sheets more or less copied the expected results of the isp 2010-2013 for the agricultural and 'pistes and bacs' sectors. the partner committee (comitÃ© des partenaires - compar) approved the two identification sheets on 27 september 2012 (see identification sheet in appendix 2) and, consequently, the formulation of these two interventions was possible. however, in view of their close connection (it is the agricultural programme that determines the rural roads to be opened), the special partner committee of 15 january 2013 (see comparative point in annex 9.2 of the drafting report in appendix 3) decided to merge both interventions into one programme (prodadet). ) consisting of two parts and for which only one formulation was needed. the formulation of the project took eight months (from april to december 2013). the two identification sheets were faithfully followed, but towards the end of the formulation the two original project files were merged into one new project file with one specific objective but with a part of agriculture and a section of access (see page 14 of formulation report in appendix 3). ). after the formulation of prodadet, the budgetary supervisory authorities ruled that the 2 initial projects could not be merged into a single dossier. the formulation team of btc has split the file prodadet back into the originally two planned files prodat and prodet. for prodet an extra mission to tshopo was organised in may 2014 to make an inventory of the rural roads to be rehabilitated and the most realistic possible estimate of the costs for the rehabilitation of these roads (see point 7.5 of the dtf in annex) as well as for the costs of maintenance (see point 7.6 of the dtf in appendix 4) .general purpose: revenue revenues des exploitation familiales dans les zones cibles du district de la tshopo sont augmentÃ©s grÃ¢ce a la relaire de la production agricole et contribuent Ã  la rÃ©duction de la pauvretÃ©. specific results: r1. la maÃ®trise d'ouvrage au level provincial est renforcÃ©e.r2. un rÃ©seau multimodal de transport est rÃ©habilitÃ©.r3. un rÃ©seau multimodal de transport est entretenue Ã  travers des structures locales.r4. les bonnes pratiques de l'utilisation du rÃ©seau multimodal sont promues.specific purpose: le coÃ»t du transport est diminuÃ© par la mise Ã  disposition d'un rÃ©seau de transport multimodal fonctionnel et durable. 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development BTC - Belgian Technical Cooperation - BTC Programme de Désenclavement dans le District de la Tshopo  Province Orientale (PRODET) Het ISP 2010-2013, ondertekend op 21 december 2009, weerhield drie concentratiesectoren, namelijk landbouw, rehabilitatie van plattelandswegen en onderwijs (zie bijlage 1). De interventies in de landbouw zullen te samen met de rehabilitatie van de landbouwwegen worden gerealiseerd in dezelfde 4 concentratiegebieden, namelijk de districten Kwilu en Kwango (province Bandundu), de districten Tshilenge, Kabinda en Sankuru (province Kasaï Oriental), het district Tshopo (province Orientale), en het zuiden van de provincie Maniema. Hiervoor worden omstandige budgetten voorzien: 63,5 miljoen EUR voor landbouw en 89 miljoen EUR voor rurale ontsluiting, samen goed voor 152,5 miljoen EUR of 50% van het totale budget van het ISP 2010-13 (300 miljoen).Eind mei 2012 heeft het bureau ontwikkelingssamenwerking van Ambabel Kinshasa met de Congolese overheid een identificatie atelier georganiseerd in Kisangani. Dit atelier leverde de basiselementen aan voor de opmaak van twee identificatiefiches, één voor de sector landbouw (Programme de Développement Agricole dans de district de la Tshopo - PRODAT) en de andere voor de sector 'Pistes et bacs' (Programme de Désenclavement dans le District de la Tshopo - PRODET). De beide identificatiefiches namen de te verwachten resultaten van het ISP 2010-2013 voor de sectoren landbouw en 'Pistes et bacs' min of meer over. Het partnercomité (Comité des Partenaires - COMPAR) heeft op 27 september 2012 de beide identificatiefiches goedgekeurd (zie identificatiefiche PRODET in bijlage 2) en er kon bijgevolg worden overgegaan tot de formulering van die twee interventies. Evenwel, gezien hun nauwe verbondenheid  (het is het landbouwprogramma dat de te ontsluiten plattelandswegen bepaald), besloot het speciale partnercomité van 15 januari 2013 ( zie PV COMPAR in annex 9.2 van formuleringsrapport in bijlage 3) beide interventies samen te smelten tot één programma (PRODADET) bestaande uit twee luiken en waarvoor dus nog maar één formulering nodig was. De formulering van het project heeft acht maanden in beslag genomen (van april tot december 2013). De twee identificatiefiches werden trouw gevolgd, maar naar het einde van de formulering toe werden de twee oorspronkelijke projectfiches toch samengesmolten tot één nieuwe projectfiche met nog één specifieke doelstelling maar met een luik landbouw en een luik ontsluiting (zie p. 14 van formuleringrapport in bijlage 3). Na de formulering van PRODADET werd door de budgettaire toezichthoudende instanties geoordeeld dat de 2 initiële projecten niet konden worden samen gesmolten tot één dossier.  Het formuleringsteam van BTC heeft het dossier PRODADET terug opgesplitst in de oorspronkelijk twee voorziene dossiers PRODAT en PRODET. Voor PRODET werd in mei 2014 een extra missie naar Tshopo georganiseerd om een inventaris te maken van de te rehabiliteren plattelandswegen en een zo realistisch mogelijke schatting van de kosten voor de rehabilitatie van deze wegen (zie punt 7.5 van DTF in bijlage ) evenals voor de kosten van onderhoud (zie punt 7.6 van DTF in bijlage 4 ).GENERAL PURPOSE:  Les revenus des exploitations familiales dans les zones cibles du district de la Tshopo sont augmentés grâce à une relance durable de la production agricole et contribuent à la réduction de la pauvreté.SPECIFIC RESULTS:  R1. La maîtrise d'ouvrage au niveau provinciale est renforcée.R2. Un réseau multimodal de transport est réhabilité.R3. Un réseau multimodal de transport est entretenue à travers des structures locales.R4. Les bonnes pratiques de l'utilisation du réseau multimodal sont promues.SPECIFIC PURPOSE:  Le coût du transport est diminué par la mise à disposition d'un réseau de transport multimodal fonctionnel et durable.

 directorate general for cooperation and development international committee of the red cross icrc activities in irak, nigeria, south sudan, afghanistan, car and ukraine iraq is currently facing a triple crisis: security (daesh), humanitarian (1/3 of the iraqi population needs humanitarian aid) and economic (fall in the price of a barrel of oil). humanitarian operations are taking place in one of the most volatile and complex contexts ever known. 10 million people are in need, including 3 million are in the territory controlled by daesh. the humanitarian consequences of the military operations taking place in the country are catastrophic. the conflict is causing massive waves of population displacement within the country (since 2014, more than 3.2 million people have been forcibly displaced). poverty is increasing dramatically as families find it increasingly difficult to feed themselves, to heal themselves and to live in housing. child begin to be massively out of school (2m). access is particularly complicated: it is impossible to access areas controlled by daesh, and very difficult elsewhere, especially for security reasons. all indicators point to a worsening of the crisis that could, if nothing changes, push more than 2 million people to flee iraq by the end of 2016. protection is a major issue of this crisis (indiscriminate bombings that affect civilians, sexual violence, sectarian violence in sharp increase, murders, kidnappings, looting ...). violations of international humanitarian law (dih) are legion in iraq, by both state and non state armed groups, and the populations are direct victims. beyond the suffering and destruction that these dih violations cause, they also exacerbate sectarian and ethnic tensions and complicate post-crisis management. beyond that, people's livelihoods, including family farming, must be supported to limit the erosion of the resilience of iraqi families. this context, whose needs reach 861 million us dollar (and only 198 of which are now insured), calls for emergency interventions, particularly for populations living in conflict zones. general purpose: in iraq, the icrc's operation aims to: -visit detainees, monitor their treatment and living conditions, -clarify the fate of missing persons, -assist displaced persons and residents to meet their needs primary during emergencies and restore their livelihoods in the most remote / neglected areas and affected by violence; -support physical rehabilitation, primary health and hospital services; -prepare aquifer, sanitary and penitentiary infrastructure; -promote the dih to the authorities, armed forces and groups; -coordinate his work with the iraqi crescent.specific purpose: 1. afghanistan-visit detainees, monitor their treatment and living conditions and help them stay in touch with their families; -monitor the conduct of hostilities in the country and work to prevent any consequent violations of dih - assist injured persons and persons with disabilities - support health and hospital care - improve access to water and sanitation services - promote accession to and national implementation of the dih treaties and the respect of the dhh by the armed forces - assist the afghan red crescent in strengthening its capacities. central african republic -protect and assist those affected by the armed conflict; -provide emergency assistance and medical, surgical and psychological assistance to those in need; -assist those in need to restore their livelihoods-rehabilitate access to water and sanitation services; -visit the detainees, monitor their

 directorate general for cooperation and development united nations office of co-ordination of humanitarian affairs emergency response fund (lebanon) the humanitarian situation is steadily worsening in syria (estimates of needs in 2015 by one: us $ 8.4 billion), but resources to cope with them are still lacking. in 2014, only us $ 4.9 billion of the us $ 6.5 billion requested by one for syria and the region was actually paid. the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance is over 12.2 million, of which 4.8 million live in hard-to-reach areas or 5.6 million children. syria now has more than 7.6 million internally displaced people (and 3.8 million refugees in neighbouring countries). access to food (for more than 9.8 million people), clean water (for 11.6 million people) or health care (for more than half of the population) are among the most urgent humanitarian issues. this is compounded by the destruction of a quarter of the schools or 1.2 million houses causing an immediate need for housing for more than 1.6 million people. belgium has already financed the erf syria in 2013 to the tune of 4,500,000 million eur. in view of the needs, new funding for this fund is amply justified in 2015.general purpose: emergency response funds (erf) have been established in more than 20 countries since 1997 to provide ngo and un agencies fast and flexible financing. since 2009, bcah has established a new york-based funding coordination section, which oversees country-specific donor funds. this section has developed guidelines aimed at (i) standardizing the tools and process for erms management and (ii) ensuring that all funds are based on lessons learned, evaluations and good practices collected by the the term "emergency response fund" covers a series of pooled funds of donors sharing common general characteristics: - these funds operate under the direction and supervision of the humanitarian coordinator; - they provide the recipient organisations with a fast-track financing mechanism; flexible at the level of the country of intervention - they can finance new or unforeseen needs (not foreseen in the common humanitarian action plans) - they can finance life-saving activities in case of critical under-funding cap (consolidated appeal process) and thus fill urgent needs on the short-term; - finally, they are relatively small in terms of size. women do not go against funding activities that are outside the scope of humanitarian action. similarly, they are not designed to be the primary source of funding for country-based humanitarian programmes (although they may, where appropriate, address urgent, unfunded needs). this does not mean, however, that when a plan of prioritisation of the humanitarian intervention exists (cap, common humanitarian action plan, strategic response plan, ...), the erf must not work within the framework of the objectives defined by this plan. the erf works on the basis of the priorities defined by the humanitarian coordinator and the humanitarian country team. the erfs make it possible to facilitate the coordination of humanitarian activities and to avoid duplication of efforts. they also help strengthen partnerships between the united nations and non one actors through equitable access to funds, representation on the advisory board and fund review panel, and transparent decision making mechanisms. erfs complement other funding channels, such as deer. a work of harmonisation of the procedures and mechanisms of management and allocation of the funds of the deer and the erfs is indeed accomplished. humanitarian coordinators are encouraged to use the structures and frameworks 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development UN UNOCHA -  Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs - PRT Emergency Reponse Fund (Syrie) GENERAL PURPOSE:  Les fonds d'intervention d'urgence (Emergency Response Fund  - ERF) ont été établis dans plus de 20 pays depuis 1997 pour fournir aux ONGs et aux agences des Nations Unies un financement rapide et souple.  Depuis 2009, le BCAH a créé une section de coordination des financements (FCS- Funding Coordination Section), établie à New York, qui supervise les fonds communs de donateurs de type pays. Cette section a développé des lignes directrices destinées à (i) standardiser les outils et la processus de gestion des ERFs et à (ii) s'assurer que tous les fonds s'appuient sur les lessons learned, les évaluations et bonnes pratiques recueillis par le BCAH.L'appellation « Emergency Response Fund » couvre une série de fonds communs de donateurs partageant des caractéristiques générales communes :-Ces fonds opèrent sous la direction et la surveillance du coordinateur humanitaire ;-Ils fournissent aux organisations récipiendaires un mécanisme de financement rapide et flexible au niveau du pays d'intervention ;-Ils permettent de financer des besoins nouveaux ou imprévisibles (non prévus dans les plans d'action humanitaire communs) ;-Ils peuvent financer des activités visant à sauver des vies en cas de sous-financement critique du CAP (Consolidated Appeal Process) et combler ainsi des besoins urgents sur du court-terme ; -Enfin, ils sont relativement petits en termes de taille.Les ERFs ne vont pas contre pas financer des activités qui se trouvent en dehors du champ d'action humanitaire. De même, ils ne sont pas conçus pour être la source première de financement des programmes humanitaires pays (même s'ils peuvent, les cas échéant, combler des besoins urgents non-financés). Ceci ne veut toutefois pas dire que, lorsqu'un plan de priorisation de l'intervention humanitaire existe (CAP, Common Humanitarian Action Plan, Strategic Response Plan,), l'ERF ne doive pas travailler dans le cadre des objectifs définis par ce plan. L'ERF travaille en effet sur base des priorités définies par le coordinateur humanitaire et l'équipe humanitaire pays.Les ERFs permettent de faciliter la coordination des activités humanitaires et d'éviter une duplication des efforts. Ils participent également au renforcement des partenariats entre les Nations Unies et les acteurs non-UN grâce à un accès équitable aux fonds, une représentation au conseil consultatif et à la commission d'examen du fonds, et à des mécanismes de décisions transparents.Enfin, les ERFs complètent d'autres canaux de financement, tel que le CERF. Un travail d'harmonisation des procédures et mécanismes de gestion et d'attribution des fonds du CERF et des ERFs est d'ailleurs accompli. Les coordinateurs humanitaires sont d'ailleurs encouragés à utiliser les structures et cadres de consultations des ERFs  lorsqu'ils existent  comme base pour identifier et prioriser les projets susceptibles d'être financés par le CERF.

 directorate general for cooperation and development international committee of the red cross icrc activities in irak, nigeria, south sudan, afghanistan, car and ukraine south sudan has been suffering from armed conflict for decades, as well as frequent natural disasters and epidemics. since the beginning of the civil war in december 2013, the months of intense fighting have followed one another, have devastated this young country, and weakened and weakened its population. the disaster displaced about 2.3 million people, or one in five, mainly because of widespread violence against civilians. despite the signing of the peace agreement, the security situation is very fragile in southern sudan, marked by continued violence and ceasefire violations. the humanitarian situation has deteriorated in recent months: besides the fact that civilians continue to be attacked and displaced, the conflict has spread geographically, displacing 150,000 people. since january 2016, 55,500 south sudanese have arrived in sudan, due to food insecurity due to the armed conflict and the failure of the agricultural season which has led to a shortage of food, resulting in higher grain prices . significant difficulties in humanitarian access persist, caused by conflicts between rival south-sudanese factions. it is also violence against humanitarian personnel (49 humanitarian workers killed since the beginning of the conflict). many humanitarian goods have also been looted or destroyed. all those involved in the conflict have committed serious violations and abuses of human rights and consequent violations of international humanitarian law. these violations are currently being pursued with the same intensity. in afghanistan, the icrc's operation aims to: -visit the detainees, monitor their treatment and living conditions and help them stay in touch with their families; monitor the conduct of hostilities in the country and work to prevent any consequent violations of dih - assist injured persons and persons with disabilities - support health and hospital care - improve access services water and sanitation; -promote the accession to and national implementation of dih treaties and the respect of the dih by the armed forces; -assist the afghan red crescent to strengthen its capabilities.specific purpose: 1. afghanistan-render visit to detainees, monitor their treatment and living conditions and help them stay in touch with their families; -monitor the conduct of hostilities in the country and work in the meadow avoiding dih violations that may ensue - assisting injured persons and disabled people - supporting health and hospital care - improving water and sanitation services - promoting accession to and the national implementation of the dih treaties and the respect for the dih by the armed forces -assist the afghan red crescent to strengthen its capacities.2. central african republic -protect and assist those affected by the armed conflict; -provide emergency assistance and medical, surgical and psychological assistance to those in need; -assist those in need to restore their livelihoods-rehabilitate access to water and sanitary services - visit prisoners, monitor their treatment and living conditions - restore family ties between separated parents - promote the dih and humanitarian principles to the authorities, forces and groups armed forces and civil society -assist the central african red cross to strengthen its capabilities.3. visit the detainees, monitor their treatment and living conditions, clarify the fate of missing persons, assist displaced persons and residents to meet their basic needs during emergencies and restore their livelihoods 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development UN Office of the  High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR_HCR - UNHCR - PRT Contribution to underfunded emergencies in Cameroon, CAR, South Sudan and Jordan In December 2013, the Central African Republic was devastated by internal conflict as instability and waves of violence between the ex-Seleka and anti-Balaka forces enveloped the country. Since the conflict's outset, roughly 452,095 Central African refugees have sought asylum in the CAR's neighboring countries, including Chad (68,743 refugees), Cameroon (259,145 refugees), Republic of Congo (28,601 refugees) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (95,606 refugees). Within CAR, the war caused massive displacement of populations with about 900 000 IDPs recorded at the height ofthe conflict in 2014 while several thousands of muslim denomination were trapped in enclaves. The gradual improvement of the political and security environment in CAR has led to a relative stabilization of humanitarian situation, signalling a potential shift towards a possible return and reintegration of the displaced populations. While refugee figures in the asylum country shave remained stable, the number of IDPs has reduced to 385,750 with some 48,000 in the capital. During the conflict, CAR has continued to host different refugee populations in Bangui (2300 refugees), Zemio (2800 refugees from DRC) and Bambari (1900 refugees from Sudan).GENERAL PURPOSE:  Better respond to the most urgent needs of the displaced in CAR,

 directorate general for cooperation and development united nations office of co-ordination of humanitarian affairs emergency reponse fund (syria) general purpose: emergency response funds (erfs) have been established in more than 20 countries since 1997 to provide unos and un agencies with fast and flexible funding. since 2009, bcah has established a new york-based funding coordination section, which oversees country-specific donor funds. this section has developed guidelines aimed at (i) standardizing the tools and process for erms management and (ii) ensuring that all funds are based on lessons learned, evaluations and good practices collected by the the term "emergency response fund" covers a series of pooled funds of donors sharing common general characteristics: - these funds operate under the direction and supervision of the humanitarian coordinator; - they provide the recipient organisations with a fast-track financing mechanism; flexible at the level of the country of intervention - they can finance new or unforeseen needs (not foreseen in the common humanitarian action plans) - they can finance life-saving activities in case of critical under-funding cap (consolidated appeal process) and thus fill urgent needs on the short-term; - finally, they are relatively small in terms of size. women do not go against funding activities that are outside the scope of humanitarian action. similarly, they are not designed to be the primary source of funding for country-based humanitarian programmes (although they may, where appropriate, address urgent, unfunded needs). this does not mean, however, that when a plan of prioritisation of the humanitarian intervention exists (cap, common humanitarian action plan, strategic response plan, ...), the erf must not work within the framework of the objectives defined by this plan. the erf works on the basis of the priorities defined by the humanitarian coordinator and the humanitarian country team. the erfs make it possible to facilitate the coordination of humanitarian activities and to avoid duplication of efforts. they also help strengthen partnerships between the united nations and non one actors through equitable access to funds, representation on the advisory board and fund review panel, and transparent decision making mechanisms. erfs complement other funding channels, such as deer. a work of harmonisation of the procedures and mechanisms of management and allocation of the funds of the deer and the erfs is indeed accomplished. humanitarian coordinators are encouraged to use the structures and frameworks of the erfs - where they exist - as a basis for identifying and prioritizing projects that can be funded by the deer. 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development UN UNOCHA -  Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs - PRT Emergency Reponse Fund (Syrie) GENERAL PURPOSE:  Les fonds d'intervention d'urgence (Emergency Response Fund  - ERF) ont été établis dans plus de 20 pays depuis 1997 pour fournir aux ONGs et aux agences des Nations Unies un financement rapide et souple.  Depuis 2009, le BCAH a créé une section de coordination des financements (FCS- Funding Coordination Section), établie à New York, qui supervise les fonds communs de donateurs de type pays. Cette section a développé des lignes directrices destinées à (i) standardiser les outils et la processus de gestion des ERFs et à (ii) s'assurer que tous les fonds s'appuient sur les lessons learned, les évaluations et bonnes pratiques recueillis par le BCAH.L'appellation « Emergency Response Fund » couvre une série de fonds communs de donateurs partageant des caractéristiques générales communes :-Ces fonds opèrent sous la direction et la surveillance du coordinateur humanitaire ;-Ils fournissent aux organisations récipiendaires un mécanisme de financement rapide et flexible au niveau du pays d'intervention ;-Ils permettent de financer des besoins nouveaux ou imprévisibles (non prévus dans les plans d'action humanitaire communs) ;-Ils peuvent financer des activités visant à sauver des vies en cas de sous-financement critique du CAP (Consolidated Appeal Process) et combler ainsi des besoins urgents sur du court-terme ; -Enfin, ils sont relativement petits en termes de taille.Les ERFs ne vont pas contre pas financer des activités qui se trouvent en dehors du champ d'action humanitaire. De même, ils ne sont pas conçus pour être la source première de financement des programmes humanitaires pays (même s'ils peuvent, les cas échéant, combler des besoins urgents non-financés). Ceci ne veut toutefois pas dire que, lorsqu'un plan de priorisation de l'intervention humanitaire existe (CAP, Common Humanitarian Action Plan, Strategic Response Plan,), l'ERF ne doive pas travailler dans le cadre des objectifs définis par ce plan. L'ERF travaille en effet sur base des priorités définies par le coordinateur humanitaire et l'équipe humanitaire pays.Les ERFs permettent de faciliter la coordination des activités humanitaires et d'éviter une duplication des efforts. Ils participent également au renforcement des partenariats entre les Nations Unies et les acteurs non-UN grâce à un accès équitable aux fonds, une représentation au conseil consultatif et à la commission d'examen du fonds, et à des mécanismes de décisions transparents.Enfin, les ERFs complètent d'autres canaux de financement, tel que le CERF. Un travail d'harmonisation des procédures et mécanismes de gestion et d'attribution des fonds du CERF et des ERFs est d'ailleurs accompli. Les coordinateurs humanitaires sont d'ailleurs encouragés à utiliser les structures et cadres de consultations des ERFs  lorsqu'ils existent  comme base pour identifier et prioriser les projets susceptibles d'être financés par le CERF.

 directorate general for cooperation and development united nations office of co-ordination of humanitarian affairs emergency reponse fund (tpo) general purpose: emergency response funds (erfs) have been established in more than 20 countries since 1997 to provide unos and un agencies with fast and flexible funding. since 2009, bcah has established a new york-based funding coordination section, which oversees country-specific donor funds. this section has developed guidelines aimed at (i) standardizing the tools and process for erms management and (ii) ensuring that all funds are based on lessons learned, evaluations and good practices collected by the the term "emergency response fund" covers a series of pooled funds of donors sharing common general characteristics: - these funds operate under the direction and supervision of the humanitarian coordinator; - they provide the recipient organisations with a fast-track financing mechanism; flexible at the level of the country of intervention - they can finance new or unforeseen needs (not foreseen in the common humanitarian action plans) - they can finance life-saving activities in case of critical under-funding cap (consolidated appeal process) and thus fill urgent needs on the short-term; - finally, they are relatively small in terms of size. women do not go against funding activities that are outside the scope of humanitarian action. similarly, they are not designed to be the primary source of funding for country-based humanitarian programmes (although they may, where appropriate, address urgent, unfunded needs). this does not mean, however, that when a plan of prioritisation of the humanitarian intervention exists (cap, common humanitarian action plan, strategic response plan, ...), the erf must not work within the framework of the objectives defined by this plan. the erf works on the basis of the priorities defined by the humanitarian coordinator and the humanitarian country team. the erfs make it possible to facilitate the coordination of humanitarian activities and to avoid duplication of efforts. they also help strengthen partnerships between the united nations and non one actors through equitable access to funds, representation on the advisory board and fund review panel, and transparent decision making mechanisms. erfs complement other funding channels, such as deer. a work of harmonisation of the procedures and mechanisms of management and allocation of the funds of the deer and the erfs is indeed accomplished. humanitarian coordinators are encouraged to use the structures and frameworks of the erfs - where they exist - as a basis for identifying and prioritizing projects that can be funded by the deer. 
Directorate General for Co-operation and Development UN UNOCHA -  Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs - PRT Emergency Reponse Fund (TpO) GENERAL PURPOSE:  Les fonds d'intervention d'urgence (Emergency Response Fund  - ERF) ont été établis dans plus de 20 pays depuis 1997 pour fournir aux ONGs et aux agences des Nations Unies un financement rapide et souple.  Depuis 2009, le BCAH a créé une section de coordination des financements (FCS- Funding Coordination Section), établie à New York, qui supervise les fonds communs de donateurs de type pays. Cette section a développé des lignes directrices destinées à (i) standardiser les outils et la processus de gestion des ERFs et à (ii) s'assurer que tous les fonds s'appuient sur les lessons learned, les évaluations et bonnes pratiques recueillis par le BCAH.L'appellation « Emergency Response Fund » couvre une série de fonds communs de donateurs partageant des caractéristiques générales communes :-Ces fonds opèrent sous la direction et la surveillance du coordinateur humanitaire ;-Ils fournissent aux organisations récipiendaires un mécanisme de financement rapide et flexible au niveau du pays d'intervention ;-Ils permettent de financer des besoins nouveaux ou imprévisibles (non prévus dans les plans d'action humanitaire communs) ;-Ils peuvent financer des activités visant à sauver des vies en cas de sous-financement critique du CAP (Consolidated Appeal Process) et combler ainsi des besoins urgents sur du court-terme ; -Enfin, ils sont relativement petits en termes de taille.Les ERFs ne vont pas contre pas financer des activités qui se trouvent en dehors du champ d'action humanitaire. De même, ils ne sont pas conçus pour être la source première de financement des programmes humanitaires pays (même s'ils peuvent, les cas échéant, combler des besoins urgents non-financés). Ceci ne veut toutefois pas dire que, lorsqu'un plan de priorisation de l'intervention humanitaire existe (CAP, Common Humanitarian Action Plan, Strategic Response Plan,), l'ERF ne doive pas travailler dans le cadre des objectifs définis par ce plan. L'ERF travaille en effet sur base des priorités définies par le coordinateur humanitaire et l'équipe humanitaire pays.Les ERFs permettent de faciliter la coordination des activités humanitaires et d'éviter une duplication des efforts. Ils participent également au renforcement des partenariats entre les Nations Unies et les acteurs non-UN grâce à un accès équitable aux fonds, une représentation au conseil consultatif et à la commission d'examen du fonds, et à des mécanismes de décisions transparents.Enfin, les ERFs complètent d'autres canaux de financement, tel que le CERF. Un travail d'harmonisation des procédures et mécanismes de gestion et d'attribution des fonds du CERF et des ERFs est d'ailleurs accompli. Les coordinateurs humanitaires sont d'ailleurs encouragés à utiliser les structures et cadres de consultations des ERFs  lorsqu'ils existent  comme base pour identifier et prioriser les projets susceptibles d'être financés par le CERF.

 directorate general for cooperation and development united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east education in emergencies for palestine refugee child below is the humanitarian context as far as training is concerned, but it must be clear that the humanitarian impact of the conflict in syria and neighbouring countries is many times larger and wider because of the war in syria. before the start of the conflict, about 67,000 child of palestinian refugees were in syria. in february 2013, this number was 26,000. now unrwa has succeeded in raising the number back to 45.541. but training is often interrupted and has suffered a considerable loss of quality. in lebanon, the school system - which was expanded by unrwa - comes under pressure from the influx of child of palestinian refugees from syria (prs). and those prs child need extra guidance because the curriculum in lebanon is different and because sciences and mathematics are taught in another language.in gaza the effects of the blockade were exacerbated by the hostilities of 2008-2009, 2012 and 2014. around 1,000 child suffered a permanent disability and more than 300,000 child need psychosocial support as a result of war trauma. due to the precarious situation, boys especially risk leaving school in a search for livelihoods for the family. in jordan, child of palestinian refugees from syria often stay in sub-standard encampments and the families are struck by bitter poverty. all this has a negative influence on the education of child from such families. and also in the west bank the deteriorated political situation has led to new violence, upheaval, trauma and fear among many young children. unrwa in any case observes an increase in safety incidents (including tear gas, bullets and sound bombs) involving schools. in short, in the five areas where unrwa is active: syria, lebanon, jordan, western bank and gaza, there is a growing number of young people. who, for various reasons, no longer receive full-fledged training. the unrwa project tries to remedy this problem. general purpose: the right to education for child of palestinian refugees - which is currently being damaged by poverty, crisis and conflict - is once again guaranteed and promoted.

In part with Canada's support, the World Food Program (WFP) is helping to meet the emergency food needs of drought-affected people in some of the countries and regions worst hit by El NiÃ±o, including: Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan in eastern Africa; Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe in southern Africa; El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua in the Americas, and Papua New Guinea in the Asia Pacific region. Although specific programming differs based on each country context, WFP is saving lives and protecting livelihoods through the provision of direct general food assistance, cash-for-work or food-for-work schemes, and targeted supplementary feeding for particularly vulnerable groups.

The amounts and frequency of payments will vary depending on well-defined vulnerability criteria and whether a family is newly displaced, in need of assistance to support their return to areas no longer under the control of ISIL, in a situation of protracted displacement, or a host community household experiencing the stresses of protracted crisis. / Mars 2016 - La situation humanitaire en Irak continue de se détériorer. La violence entre les groupes armés et les forces gouvernementales a contraint plus de 3,2 millions de personnes à quitter leurs foyers. Selon les estimations, 10 millions de personnes en Irak ont été touchées par le conflit et ont besoin d'aide humanitaire. La demande a dépassé la capacité du gouvernement à combler les besoins de base de ses citoyens. En 2016, davantage de gens seront déplacés par le conflit, alors que bon nombre d'autres personnes déjà déplacées demeureront dans des camps et dans leurs pays d'accueil. Cependant, un nombre sans cesse croissant de personnes retourneront dans des régions qui ne sont plus contrôlées par l'EIIL. Ces personnes auront aussi besoin d'aide pour recommencer leur vie.   Grâce au soutien d'AMC, le projet vise à fournir de l'aide financière d'urgence destinée à diverses fins à jusqu'à 30 912 personnes nouvellement déplacées, appelées à composer avec un déplacement prolongé ou retournant dans leur région d'origine. Ce projet sera réalisé en Irak par un consortium de quatre grandes organisations internationales : le Mercy Corps, le Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés, le Conseil danois pour les réfugiés et le Comité international de secours. Les montants et la fréquence des paiements varieront en fonction de critères de vulnérabilité bien définis et selon qu'une famille fait l'objet d'un déplacement récent ou prolongé ou a besoin d'une aide p

IPP has also in an important role in achieving a goal set in the Finland?s Development Policy Programme 2012: traditional grant-based bilateral development cooperation with Vietnam will decrease and give way to more comprehensive partnerships between the two countries.Planned to span for five years (2013?2018) IPP II builds on the foundation laid during the first phase of the programme. IPP II endeavours to create an ?innovation ecosystem? that strengthens the expertise and competence of all multi helix stakeholders as well as the awareness of stakeholders about each others? roles. The goal is to develop an approach that multiplies the number of innovative products and services thus creating added value and employment. IPP II has three result areas: 1) strengthened institutional capacity of multi-helix stakeholders 2) increased number of the partnerships between the stakeholders and 3) innovative products and services created. As IPP I the phase II of the programme is implemented by Vietnam?s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).

The original appraisal (2013) covered UNRWA's emergency appeals both in Palestine and the Syria crisis, but was divided into two decisions and agreements. From 2017 onwards a new UNRWA appraisal is planned, combining the Sida support to both UNRWA emergency appeals into one agreement. Through this decision Sida supports UNRWA:s emergency programme for the Syria crisis in 2016, which aims at answering to the humanitarian needs of the Palestine refugees affected by the Syria crisis. The target group includes 430,000 Palestinians in Syria, 42,000 Palestine refugees from Syria now in Lebanon and 17,000 in Jordan. In combination with Sida's support to the Emergency Appeal for the West Bank and Gaza, this support complements the Swedish core contribution to UNRWA's General Fund. The size of the contribution is motivated by the Palestine refugees' vulnerabilities in the context and particular protection needs. Due to UNRWA's specific mandate to serve the Palestine refugees it is the only channel for this purpose. The programme has three strategic priorities: To preserve the resilience of vulnerable families through the provision of humanitarian assistance, (2) to provide a protective framework for Palestine refugees to mitigate their vulnerability, and (3) to strengthen humanitarian capacity, coordination and management of the emergency response. The appeal is USD 414 milllion, of which 80% is allocated inside Syria. A large share of the programme is channeled as cash assistance, and UNRWA is the only organisation in Syria with cash based programming on a large scale. UNRWA is a self-implementing organisation, meaning no funds will be channeled further. All funds shall be disbursed immediately after signing the agreement to enable planning and implementation without delay.

The Tanzanian government together with three partners; the World Bank, the UK and Sweden, have jointly prepared an updated program under the new name  Education Program for Results (EPforR) , with payments dependent on the degree of results achievements, during the years 2017-2020.The introduction of the free basic education means that informal fees are being eliminated and that lower secondary school is now free of charge. Enrollments to primary school has as a consequence increased sharply in 2016 (by about half a million children - more than 40%), which have resulted in an acute shortage of infrastructure, learning materials and teachers. To uphold the recent gains in quality of education, while also catering for learning needs of these new groups of pupils that often come from poor and marginalized families, is a formidable challenge that will require increased resources, as well as, improved efficiency. Otherwise, there is a high risk that the achievements made in recent years cannot be maintained and that the quality of education deteriorates again.EPforR is expected to play an important role both financially and technically to sustain and improve further the results achieved during BRNEd in terms of improved exam results, increased reading skills, better statistics and more equitable distribution of teachers and resources including capitation grants. The expanded contribution builds on the lessons learned over the first two years of implementation and retains the same development objective: to improve the quality of education in Tanzanian primary and secondary schools.Support for delivering results on the basis of the key reforms that were initiated during BRNEd continues incentivizing that: capitation grants arrives in time to the schools; teacher are motivated; even distribution of teacher resources, transparency and publishing of school statistics, schools that improve are rewarded, and increasing skills in reading, writing and arithmetic (3R) already at early ages.Support for already completed activities cease, and are being replaced with incentives for: a quality assurance system with its school inspection and publication of quality assessments at a school level in order to raise the general level of quality; girls' education and opportunities to continue to high school (secondary school); access to textbooks; and incentives for completing school and prevent drop-outs.

 swedish international development authority recipient government zambia social protection expansion programme 2016-2018 the contribution is intended to support the government of zambia with sek 105 000 000 during three years to expand and consolidate the country's programme for social cash transfers (sct). the programme now covers about 50 districts. the goal is for all 105 districts to be reached by the programme in 2017. the zambian social cash transfer programme targets households identified as being extremely poor and where a member of the household is not working, either because of old age (over 65 years) or more serious disabilities. a sum of approximately us dollar 7 per month is paid every month to households identified through a controlled process of selection. households with a function impaired member may double. because of the high rate of inflation in zambia the value of the cash transfer will increase to about us dollar 9 per month. a constrained budget makes it difficult for the government to comit itself to this increase in value. the donor will thereroe fill this gap during 2016 and 2017 and thereafter decrease their share, with the intention to keep ownership by the government. this explain the big amount of the disbursement for 2017.the programme includes no so-called conditional components, where the receiver must perform something to get the cash transfer. the initiative strengthens the role of women in zambian society by giving preference for women to receive the payments. only in cases where there is no adult woman in household is the cash paid out to a man.sweden's contribution will go directly to the ministry for community development and social welfare and to a specific account linked to the program. two bilateral donors, dfid and ireland, already support the programme and sida would therefore enter into an already existing modality for delivery of support. finland is at same appraisal stage as sweden. sida's contribution will be mingled with that of other donors' money along with the government funding of the program. the money will go to both operating costs and to the cash transfers.the zambian government has developed a plan for how the programme will be scaled up to cover all districts by the end of 2017. the biggest challenge during 2015 and the beginning of 2016 was the backlog in payments by government, from the ministry of finance, with the consequence that the actual payment of transfers was significantly delayed. after the ministry of finance reclassified programme to a so-called statutory protected grant, the payments has flowed without problems.linked to the sct programme underway, is an extensive united nations joint programme of technical assistance for capacity building. sweden signed an agreement with united nations international children s emergency fund for support to this programme in december 2015. these two contributions are complementary. the support to zambia social protection expansion programme will give the zambian government financial resources to expand the sct programme, while the support thorugh united nations international children s emergency fund will build the technical capacity to manage the programme effectively.
